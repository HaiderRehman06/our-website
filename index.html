        <h2>Honeybee</h2>
        <p>The humble bumblebee (Bombus spp.) is a social insect known 
            for its fuzzy black and yellow body. These bees live in colonies 
            led by a queen and play a vital role in pollination. Unlike honeybees, bumblebees
             can vibrate their wings rapidly to generate heat, allowing them to forage in cooler 
             climates and earlier in the spring. Their waggle dance, a complex shaking movement, 
             communicates the location of food sources to other bees in the colony.</p>
